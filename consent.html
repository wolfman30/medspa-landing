            <h2>Program Overview</h2>
            <p>
                AI Wolf Solutions provides missed-call follow-ups, appointment follow-ups,
                and concierge support via SMS on behalf of participating medical spas. The SMS
                program is designed to help patients reconnect with clinic staff, reschedule
                appointments, request callbacks, and receive answers to frequently asked
                questions.

            <h2>Opt-In Methods</h2>
            <p>
                Patients opt in to SMS messaging when they:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Submit a booking or inquiry form that includes SMS consent language.</li>
                <li>Text START to our concierge number <strong>937-896-2713</strong>.</li>
                <li>Provide verbal consent to clinic staff, who record the approval in our system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By opting in, patients agree to receive automated text messages related to their
                inquiries or appointments. Message frequency varies based on engagement but will
                not exceed four messages per inquiry without additional consent.

            <h2>Opt-Out Instructions</h2>
            <p>

                opt-out and cancel any pending follow-up messages. Replying START or UNSTOP will
                restore messaging if the patient wishes to opt back in.

                    <strong>Clinic information.</strong> Contact names, phone numbers, email
                    addresses, and business details provided by clinics onboarding with our
                    platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Patient information.</strong> Phone numbers, names, appointment

                    <strong>Usage data.</strong> Log files, message delivery records, and aggregate

            <p>We process personal information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deliver appointment reminders, follow-up messages, and concierge support.</li>
                <li>Route inquiries to clinic staff and track resolution status.</li>
                <li>Maintain consent records and comply with telecom regulations.</li>
                <li>Improve product reliability, troubleshoot issues, and develop new features.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Legal Basis and Consent Management</h2>
            <p>
                We rely on patient consent captured via SMS opt-ins, web forms, or recorded consent
                by clinic staff. Patients can revoke consent at any time by replying STOP or by
                requesting removal through the clinic. We honor opt-out requests immediately and
                document the change.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>
                We do not sell personal information. We share data only with the clinic that
                engages our services, with vendors assisting in service delivery (such as cloud
                infrastructure providers), or as required by law. Vendors are bound by contracts to
                safeguard data and use it solely for the contracted purpose.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                We employ encryption in transit, role-based access controls, and logging to protect
                stored information. While no system is completely secure, we regularly review
                safeguards and limit access to authorized personnel.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                We retain message history and consent records for as long as necessary to support
                clinics, comply with regulations, or resolve disputes. Clinics may request deletion
                of specific patient records, and we will process the request within a reasonable
                timeframe.
            </p>
